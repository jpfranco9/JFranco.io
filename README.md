I am proficient in R, SPSS, SAS, SQL, PowerBI, Tableau, and ArcGIS; additionally, I have developed surveys and implemented them on platforms such as Qualtrics, QuestionPro, and Google Forms. I am committed to continuous learning and innovation in data analytics, always seeking new programs and skills to learn and improve data products. I have recently completed a UI UX Bootcamp to enhance my design skills and develop visualizations that improve how users interpret and interact with data, ensuring accessibility, engagment, and enhancing comprehension. Throughout my career, I have successfully collaborated with diverse teams and engaged with stakeholders at all levels to ensure that data-driven solutions align with program goals.
